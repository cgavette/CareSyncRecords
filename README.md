# CareSyncRecords
This is a mock website that is used for managing patients in a hospital database. The reason for building this is to practice using ASP.NET and to work on LINQ within an application. I used Visual Studio as the main IDE and Visual Studio Code for some of the CSS styling to make it easier.
